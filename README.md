# Hi üëã, I'm Erik Vieira Suris

## üåå About Me

I'm a passionate software engineering student that discovered the world of programming at the age of 13 through game development. Since then, I‚Äôve gained experience in technology, particularly in the areas of Information Security (IAM) and DevOps (QA and Automation). I've led automation and process improvement projects, primarily using Python.

I‚Äôm currently in the 5th semester of my Software Engineering degree at PUCRS, where I was awarded academic merit for outstanding performance in all semesters completed so far, since 2023. These achievements reflect my commitment, discipline, and ability to learn quickly, as well as a strong interest in pursuing an academic path (Master's/Ph.D).

One of my key strengths is my multidisciplinary perspective‚ÄîI understand the full software engineering cycle, from requirements engineering, verification and validation, to software architecture and development. I‚Äôm continuously looking for opportunities to specialize in QA and DevOps in order to consolidate my knowledge and reach professional excellence.
